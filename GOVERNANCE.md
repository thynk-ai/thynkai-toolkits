# Governance (thynkai-toolkits)

This repository ships tooling that other repos depend on.

## When to open a proposal

Open an issue first for:
- breaking changes to CLI flags or output formats
- changes that alter default behavior in potentially destructive ways
- changes to templates that impact downstream repos

## Decision rule

Maintainers evaluate:
- safety and reversibility
- compatibility and migration cost
- clarity and documentation
